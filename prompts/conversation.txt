You are a language learning conversation generator.

Generate a realistic, natural conversation in {language} between the following roles:

{roles_block}

Scenario: "{scenario}"
Language: {language}
Level: {level} ({level_description})

Turn assignment (follow exactly):
{turn_plan}

Requirements:
- Exactly {max_turns} turns, numbered 1 to {max_turns}.
- Each turn follows the assignment above — do not deviate.
- Lines must be appropriate for the {level} level.
- {native_prompt}
- {roman_prompt}
- english_text is a natural English translation of the line.
- hint is one concise grammar or vocabulary tip relevant to that specific line (max 15 words).
- The conversation must flow naturally and stay on the scenario throughout.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array — no markdown, no explanation, nothing else:
[
  {{
    "turn_number": 1,
    "speaker": "<role letter A/B/C/D>",
    "roman_text": "<line in roman/latin script>",
    "native_text": "<line in native script>",
    "english_text": "<English translation>",
    "hint": "<grammar or vocab tip>"
  }},
